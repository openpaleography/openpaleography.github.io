title: Open Resources for the Study of Manuscripts
---

The Open Paleography project is using [the CITE architecture](http://cite-architecture.github.io/) to organize collaboratively assembled information about manuscripts.  

Material we are collecting includes:



1. Sources for [openly licensed images](http://openpaleography.github.io/img_sources/) of manuscripts
2. [Documentation about manuscripts](http://openpaleography.github.io/mss/) illustrated by openly licensed images
3. [Cataloging contents of manuscripts](http://openpaleography.github.io/msscatalog) illustrated by openly licensed images
4. Structured paleogaphic obversations linked to canonically cited images


By relating paleographic observations to basic catalog information about manuscripts and documentary visual information, the Open Paleography collections can create a new kind of resource for the study and reading of documents from digital facsimiles.
