The Open Paleography project is using [the CITE architecture](http://cite-architecture.github.io/) to organize collaboratively assembled sets of paleographic observations.   By relating paleographic observations to basic catalog information about manuscripts and documentary visual information, the Open Paleography collections can create a new kind of resource for the study and reading of documents from digital facsimiles.

## Data sets ##

- [Digital models of manuscripts](http://openpaleography.github.io/mss/)
- Sources for [openly licensed images](http://openpaleography.github.io/img_sources/) of manuscripts
